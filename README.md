This repository is about our proposed paper for high-resolution salient object detection： ”Dual-path Processing Network for High-resolution Salient Object Detection”
Due to the patent application of paper design, it is not convenient to submit the code at this stage. After everything is processed, we will upload the code here for exchange and learning.
